# Wine Tasting Dashboard

The scripts in this repo are for collecting data (via Google Forms), pulling that data from google every minute and refreshing the dashboard until the process is killed. The dashboard (vanilla html page) is also set to refresh itself every minute so the automatically updating html will appear.

Data submission form: http://jmwerner.github.io/wine

Dashboard example:  http://jmwerner.github.io/wine/dashboard.html
